# STM32-Embedded-System-Lab
This repository was created because the course sucks.

## Getting Started

You have to download STM32CubeIDE First. Then, select board STM32F4DISCOVERY and select debugger as J-LINK.

[See Getting Started in Lab1](https://github.com/tongplw/STM32-Embedded-System-Lab/blob/master/Lab1%20Basic%20MCU%20development%20on%20STM32/Lab1-Main.pdf)

## TIM timer characteristics
